"""AG-UI HTTP/SSE server for Hermes.

Exposes a single POST endpoint that accepts an AG-UI ``RunAgentInput`` and
streams AG-UI protocol events (SSE). It runs the synchronous Hermes
``AIAgent`` on a worker thread; assistant text, reasoning, AND server-tool
calls stream live via ``AGUIEventBridge`` (Hermes' ``stream_delta_callback`` /
``reasoning_callback`` / ``tool_progress_callback`` / ``step_callback``).

Because server-tool events stream live, a server tool card renders IN ORDER —
after any preamble text, before the model's follow-up narration — without
buffering text (live token streaming is preserved). The live callbacks do not
carry the model's real tool_call_id, so live server-tool events use generated
ids; that is fine because server tools self-correlate (no client round-trip).

Frontend (client-executed) tools use Hermes' interrupt mechanism — see
``agui_adapter/session.py``. When the model calls one, the run unwinds; the
adapter emits the frontend tool call WITHOUT a result and finishes the run.
Any server-side tools called in the same turn ran first (the batch is
sequential) and streamed their results live. The client executes the frontend
tool and starts a new run with the result appended to ``messages``. Frontend
tools need the model's REAL id (for resume correlation), so they are emitted
POST-run from the message list — the bridge skips them in the live path.

Run framing:

    RUN_STARTED
      -> (live)  TEXT_MESSAGE_* / REASONING_MESSAGE_* / TOOL_CALL_* (server)
      -> (post)  STATE_SNAPSHOT for state-writer tools (message order)
      -> (post)  TOOL_CALL_* for frontend tools (real ids, no result)
    RUN_FINISHED   (or RUN_ERROR on failure)

State-writer tools (declared via ``forwarded_props``) are INTERNAL: their
authoritative UI is the state card driven by ``StateSnapshotEvent``, not a
chatty tool chip. The bridge therefore SUPPRESSES their live ``TOOL_CALL_*`` /
``TOOL_CALL_RESULT`` events; the server emits only the snapshot the call
produced, post-run, in message order.

    to uvicorn) -- any new entry point MUST preserve that coupling.
