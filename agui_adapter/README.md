# Hermes AG-UI adapter

Run Hermes as an [AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com/) HTTP/SSE server, so AG-UI
clients (e.g. CopilotKit) can drive it from a browser.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install the adapter extra (adds the `hermes-agui` command + deps)
pip install -e '.[agui]'            # or: pip install 'hermes-agent[agui]'

# 2. One-time: make sure Hermes has a provider + model configured
hermes model                        # pick provider/model, set credentials

# 3. Start the server (binds http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default)
hermes agui                         # equivalently: hermes-agui / python -m agui_adapter
```

That's the whole thing on a local machine. `hermes-agui` **reuses your existing
`hermes model` provider and credentials** — the same ones the Hermes CLI uses —
so you don't set any API keys or endpoints yourself. Because it binds loopback,
**no auth token is required** (see [Security](#security)).

You should see:

```
Starting Hermes AG-UI adapter on 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Point any AG-UI client at **`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`** (the run endpoint is
`POST /`; there's also `GET /health`).

> `hermes agui`, the `hermes-agui` script, and `python -m agui_adapter` are
> equivalent entry points.

## Connecting a client

Any AG-UI `HttpAgent` works. With **CopilotKit**, the usual shape is a Next.js
runtime route that proxies to this server:

```ts
// app/api/copilotkit/route.ts
import { HermesAgent } from "@ag-ui/hermes";
const AGENT_URL = process.env.AGENT_URL ?? "http://localhost:8000";
const agent = new HermesAgent({ url: `${AGENT_URL}/` });
// ...register `agent` with CopilotRuntime as usual
```

The browser talks to your Next.js runtime; the runtime (server-side) talks to
`hermes-agui` on `:8000`. Because that hop is server-to-server on localhost, the
loopback/no-token setup is all you need. (See `showcase/integrations/hermes/` in
the CopilotKit repo for a complete working example.)

## Configuration

Behavioral settings live in the `agui` section of `config.yaml`
(`~/.hermes/config.yaml`), alongside every other Hermes setting — nothing is
required for the local quick start above. The **only AG-UI-specific** environment
variable is the session token, because it's a secret (Hermes reserves `.env` for
secrets). Run `hermes setup agui` for the interactive configuration flow, or
edit the section directly:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
agui:
  host: 127.0.0.1          # bind interface; any non-loopback value requires a token
  port: 8000               # listen port
  toolsets: [hermes-acp]   # Hermes toolsets exposed to the agent
  # Optional model overrides — leave blank to defer to your `hermes model` config:
  provider: ""             # e.g. "custom" for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  model: ""                # e.g. "gpt-4o"
  api_mode: ""             # "chat_completions" or "responses"
  base_url: ""             # set to bypass the resolver and call this endpoint directly
```

| Setting | Where | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agui.host` | `config.yaml` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind interface. Non-loopback requires a token (see Security). |
| `agui.port` | `config.yaml` | `8000` | Listen port. |
| `agui.toolsets` | `config.yaml` | `[hermes-acp]` | Hermes toolsets enabled for the agent. |
| `agui.provider` / `model` / `api_mode` / `base_url` | `config.yaml` | *(your `hermes model` config)* | Optional per-adapter model overrides; blank defers to the resolver. |
| `HERMES_AGUI_SESSION_TOKEN` | **`.env`** (secret) | — | Required off-loopback; optional defense-in-depth on loopback. |
| `--host` / `--port` / `--token` | `hermes agui` flags | — | Override the above per invocation. |

**Two ways it finds a provider:**

- **Default (local use):** `agui.base_url` blank → provider, credentials, and model
  are resolved per run from your `hermes model` config, exactly like the Hermes
  CLI. This is the zero-config path.
- **Explicit endpoint:** set `agui.base_url` → the hermes resolver is skipped and
  all calls go to that OpenAI-compatible URL (credentials from `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
  This is how the CopilotKit showcase points at a mock LLM, and how you'd target a
  self-hosted OpenAI-compatible server.

Example — point at a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint instead of your Hermes
config:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
agui:
  base_url: http://localhost:4010/v1
  model: gpt-4o
```

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-… hermes agui   # OPENAI_API_KEY is a secret, so it stays in the environment
```

## Security

The server dispatches terminal-capable agent work, so the bind interface
determines the auth posture (this mirrors the Hermes API server and dashboard):

- **Loopback (default) → no token.** `127.0.0.1` / `::1` / `localhost` trust the
  OS process boundary. A token is still honored if you set one.
- **Network bind → token required, fail-closed.** Binding `0.0.0.0`, `::`, or any
  specific non-loopback IP **refuses to start** without a usable
  `HERMES_AGUI_SESSION_TOKEN` (≥16 chars, not a placeholder) — an open bind to a
  terminal-capable agent is remote code execution. Clients send the token as the
  `X-Hermes-Session-Token` header (preferred) or a `?token=` query param (can
  leak into logs/history — prefer the header). `/health` is always open.
- **DNS-rebinding Host guard.** Every request's `Host` must match the bound
  interface (loopback names on a loopback bind; exact host on a specific-IP bind;
  any host on a `0.0.0.0`/`::` bind, where the token is the authorization). A
  mismatch is `400`.
- **CSRF defense.** `POST /` requires `Content-Type: application/json` (else
  `415`), forcing a browser CORS preflight so a hostile page can't silently drive
  even a loopback server.
- **Server tool names are reserved.** A frontend (`tools[]`) or state-writer
  declaration whose name matches a registered server tool — e.g. `terminal`,
  `write_file`, `execute_code` — **fails the run** with `RUN_ERROR` naming the
  offending declarations. Dispatch resolves purely by name, so accepting one
  would make the model's call execute that server tool instead of handing off to
  the client. A name also cannot be declared as both kinds, or switch between
  frontend and state-writer across runs in the same process (registration is
  process-global). Rename the client tool.
- **Dangerous-command approvals** ride AG-UI's native interrupt: the run finishes
  with `outcome:{type:"interrupt"}`, the client renders it (`useInterrupt`) and
  resumes with `resume:[{interruptId, status:"resolved", payload:{approved,
  scope}}]`. The Hermes turn parks until the decision or the approval timeout
  (default **60s** via `approvals.timeout` — raise it for a human-in-the-loop web
  UI). Silence/timeout → **deny**. Run a **single uvicorn worker**.

<details>
<summary><b>What the interrupt does NOT cover (read before exposing off-loopback)</b></summary>

The interrupt fires for **dangerous** `terminal()` commands (Hermes'
dangerous-command / Tirith checks; benign commands like `ls` run without a
prompt), including dangerous `terminal()` calls from inside an `execute_code`
script. It does **not** fire for:

- **`approvals.mode` bypasses** — `mode=off`/`--yolo` prompts for nothing;
  `mode=smart` may auto-approve via an auxiliary LLM. The interrupt/park flow is
  the default (`manual`) behavior. (The unconditional hardline floor —
  `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, fork bombs — still blocks `terminal()` regardless of mode.)
- **`execute_code`'s direct code** — a script's own `subprocess`/`os.system`/
  `ctypes`/file calls never pass through `terminal()`, so they're neither
  interrupt-gated nor scanned by the hardline floor (`os.system("rm -rf /")` in a
  script is not caught). `execute_code`'s whole-script guard auto-approves in
  this interactive context (a Hermes-core limitation, #30882). `execute_code`
  is in the default `hermes-acp` toolset.
- **`delegate_task` sub-agents** — governed by `delegation.subagent_auto_approve`
  (default **false → auto-deny**, fail-closed), not by the interrupt. Also in
  `hermes-acp`.
- **Isolated-container backends** — for an isolated `env_type` (`docker` with no
  host bind-mount, `singularity`, `modal`, `daytona`) Hermes skips the command
  guards entirely (the sandbox is the boundary), *before* the hardline floor —
  so no interrupt and no hardline block fires for `terminal()` there. (`docker`
  *with* a host bind-mount goes through the normal flow.)
- **Already-approved / allowlisted commands** — a prior `session`/`always` grant
  or the permanent allowlist auto-approves with no interrupt; an `always` grant
  is global, so a command approved "always" on the CLI also runs here silently.
- **File-write tools (`write_file`, `patch`)** — the interrupt gates shell
  commands, **not** file edits, so `write_file`/`patch` run without a prompt (an
  agent can overwrite `.env`/SSH keys without an approval). This is a **known
  gap**: Hermes core exposes no file-edit approval hook this adapter can call, so
  gating it here would require a Hermes-core change — out of scope for this
  adapter. To gate file edits, **drop `write_file`/`patch` from
  `agui.toolsets`** (in `config.yaml`), or run on an isolated `env_type`.

To make the interrupt cover **all** local code execution: run the default
(`manual`) `approvals.mode` on a non-isolated `env_type`, and set
`agui.toolsets` to a toolset that **excludes `execute_code`, `delegate_task`,
`write_file`, and `patch`**. Those are kept in the default toolset for
capability parity; excluding them is the operator's hardening lever.
</details>

**Reverse proxy / embedding notes.** The Host guard rejects any `Host` that
doesn't match `agui.host`, so a proxy must either forward a matching `Host` or
you set `agui.host` to the public hostname (which then requires a token, since
it's non-loopback). If you call `create_app(bound_host=…)`
directly instead of using `hermes-agui`, pass the real serve interface — the
token/Host checks are enforced against that value.

### Model-invisible run context for trusted embedders

An authenticated server-side BFF may need to make opaque per-request
authorization or tenancy data available to a curated server tool without
putting that data in the model prompt or AG-UI payload. Embedded deployments
can opt into the `create_app(private_context_resolver=...)` seam:

```python
from agui_adapter.private_context import get_run_private_context
from agui_adapter.server import create_app

async def resolve_private_context(request):
    # Authenticate/verify here. Never accept identity or authority from the
    # AG-UI body. Raise to reject the run with a controlled 401 response.
    return {"authorization": request.headers["x-internal-run-token"]}

app = create_app(private_context_resolver=resolve_private_context)

# Inside a server/plugin tool handler running for that request:
authorization = get_run_private_context()
```

The resolver is disabled by default. When configured it runs before the JSON
body is read or validated, so rejected callers cannot make the adapter parse
an unauthenticated body first. Its return value is bound to the worker for that
run, propagates to Hermes parallel tool workers through the existing audited
context wrapper, and resets on success or failure. It is not copied
into `RunAgentInput`, `context`, `state`, `forwarded_props`, model/provider
messages or headers, health output, or SSE events. Approval park/resume keeps
the original worker and therefore the original private context; a resume
request cannot replace it.

The resolver seam does **not** authorize ownership of an AG-UI thread or parked
approval. Resume routing uses `thread_id` plus the opaque `interrupt_id`; the
new request's resolved context is intentionally discarded rather than compared
to the original run. A multi-user embedder must authorize that the caller owns
the requested thread/resume at its BFF boundary before proxying to this adapter.
Treat `interrupt_id` as a correlation secret, not as tenant authorization.

Treat the resolver and every tool allowed to read this context as trusted code:
a malicious or careless tool can still print, return, or log data it reads.
Use a narrow opaque capability, expose only curated toolsets, avoid putting
secrets in exception messages, and keep application logs free of payloads.

## How it works

```
POST /  (RunAgentInput JSON)
  → translate.prepare_run(messages, context)   # AG-UI → Hermes history
  → session.build_run_agent(...)               # merge frontend + state-writer tool schemas; register handlers
  → AIAgent.run_conversation(...) on a worker thread
        text/reasoning → events.AGUIEventBridge → asyncio.Queue → SSE frames (live)
        tool events    → derived from the returned messages (real model ids)
        state snapshot → StateSnapshotEvent after each state-writer tool call
  RUN_STARTED … RUN_FINISHED | RUN_ERROR
```

**No Hermes core changes** — the adapter builds on mechanisms Hermes already
exposes.

### Feature support

- **Streaming** — assistant text and provider reasoning stream as
  `TEXT_MESSAGE_*` / `REASONING_MESSAGE_*`; tool calls as `TOOL_CALL_*`.
- **Frontend (client-executed) tools** — tools in `RunAgentInput.tools` are
  advertised to the model but never run server-side. Each frontend tool name is
  registered with a handler that calls `agent.interrupt()` and returns a
  placeholder; when the model calls it, the loop unwinds at its next
  top-of-loop interrupt check, the adapter emits the tool call (real id, no
  result), and the client executes it and starts a new run with the result.
- **Mixed server + frontend tool calls in one turn** — a batch containing a
  frontend tool is never parallel-safe, so Hermes runs it sequentially; server
  tools finish and append results before the frontend tool's handler interrupts.
- **Frontend context** — `RunAgentInput.context[]` is injected as a read-only
  system message (never merged into the user message, so fixture matching stays
  deterministic).
- **Forwarded props (agent config)** — `RunAgentInput.forwarded_props` (e.g.
  `{tone, expertise}` from `useAgentContext`) is rendered as its own read-only
  system message per run.
- **Inbound shared state** — `RunAgentInput.state` is injected as a
  `Current shared state: <json>` system message.
- **Multimodal** — image blocks pass through as OpenAI-style content parts;
  pure-text messages stay a plain string.
- **Resume** — when the history tail is a tool result with no new user turn,
  `resume_shim.py` (a narrow, flag-gated wrapper around `build_turn_context`)
  drops the synthetic trailing user turn so the run continues from history. It's
  a pure pass-through when the resume flag isn't set, keeping core untouched.

### Outbound shared state (state-writer tools)

CopilotKit shared-state demos need the agent to both **see** inbound state (via
the system-message injection above) and **emit** state updates when it mutates
state. Hermes has no first-class shared-state store, so the adapter provides one
per run:

1. **Seed** a run-scoped `session.RunState` from inbound `RunAgentInput.state`,
   so every emitted snapshot carries UI-set keys alongside agent-written keys.
2. **Declare** which server-executed tools write which state key via
   `forwarded_props["stateWriterTools"]` — a list or name→decl map of
   `{name, stateKey, arg?, mode?, description?, parameters?}`. `arg` picks which
   tool argument carries the value (omit → merge the whole args dict); `mode` is
   `"replace"` (default) or `"append"`.
3. **Write** — each declared tool gets a server-side handler that merges the
   call's args into the `RunState` and returns a confirmation (it does *not*
   interrupt), so the model reads the result and continues.
4. **Emit** — after the run, for each state-writer tool call (in message order),
   the server emits the normal `TOOL_CALL_*` + `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` followed by a
   `StateSnapshotEvent` carrying the full merged state as of that call.

| demo | tool | declaration |
|---|---|---|
| `shared_state_read_write` | `set_notes(notes)` | `{stateKey:"notes", arg:"notes"}` |
| `gen_ui_agent` | `set_steps(steps)` | `{stateKey:"steps", arg:"steps"}` |
| `shared_state_streaming` | `write_document(document)` | `{stateKey:"document", arg:"document"}` |
| `subagents` | `research/writing/critique_agent` | `{stateKey:"delegations", mode:"append"}` (partial — see below) |

`StateDeltaEvent` (JSON-Patch) is intentionally not emitted — a full snapshot
per call is simpler, deterministic, and CopilotKit re-renders identically.

**Shared-state limitations.** `shared_state_streaming`'s per-token growth is not
replicated (the snapshot is emitted after the tool call completes; end state is
correct). `subagents` appends the raw call args, so it captures `task`/`sub_agent`
but not the sub-agent's computed `result` (that needs a code-level handler, not a
declarative mapping).

## Tests

```bash
pip install -e '.[agui]' && pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
python -m pytest tests/agui_adapter/ -q
```

- `test_translate.py`, `test_events.py` — pure unit tests.
- `test_auth.py`, `test_approvals.py`, `test_resume_shim.py`,
  `test_tool_name_collisions.py` — security + lifecycle.
- `test_e2e_aimock.py` — end-to-end against a real
  [`@copilotkit/aimock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@copilotkit/aimock)
  fixture server. Requires Node.js plus a one-time install; these tests **skip**
  until it is present, so check for skips before trusting a green run:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p tests/agui_adapter/.aimock && cd tests/agui_adapter/.aimock
  echo '{"name":"aimock-fixture","private":true}' > package.json
  npm i @copilotkit/aimock
  ```

  Write that `package.json` first, and write it by hand — both details matter.
  Without a local `package.json`, npm walks up and installs into the
  **repo-root** `package.json` instead, leaving `.aimock/` empty and the tests
  still skipping. And `npm init -y` can't generate it here: it defaults the
  package name to the directory name, which npm rejects as invalid because
  `.aimock` starts with a dot. `.aimock/` is gitignored.
